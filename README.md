# Mission-to-Mars
Build an app that will scrape different websites for data pertaining to a Mission to Mars, then build an accompanying HTML page to display the findings. 

Adjust the original Mars web app to include all four of the hemisphere images. Use BeautifulSoup and Splinter to scrape full-resolution images of Marsâ€™ hemispheres and the titles of those images, store the scraped data in a Mongo database, use a web application to display the data, and alter the design of the web app to accommodate these images.
